"""Extractive answerer -- the default ``LLM_PROVIDER``, and a real baseline.

This backend does not generate text. It selects the sentences from the retrieved
passages that best match the question, quotes them verbatim, and attaches the
citation marker of the passage each one came from. Nothing it outputs can be
absent from the source documents.

Why this is the default rather than a hosted model:

* **The platform runs end to end with no API key and no network.** Clone, start,
  upload, ask, get a cited answer. A default that required a credential would
  make the first experience a configuration error.
* **It is a faithfulness control, not a placeholder.** Because it can only quote,
  its groundedness is 1.0 by construction. The evaluation harness reports it
  alongside the hosted providers so that a generative model's faithfulness score
  has a ceiling to be compared against. A number with no control condition is
  hard to interpret.
* **It is deterministic.** The same question over the same corpus produces the
  same answer, which is what makes retrieval changes measurable: if the answer
  moves, retrieval moved, not the sampler.

What it cannot do, stated plainly because the README must not overclaim: it
cannot paraphrase, synthesise across passages into new prose, resolve
contradictions, or answer a question whose answer is implied but never stated.
Those are the reasons to configure a hosted model. It is a strong baseline, not a
substitute for generation.
