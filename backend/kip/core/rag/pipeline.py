"""The RAG pipeline -- one question in, one grounded and cited answer out.

The stages, and what each one is responsible for:

1. **Retrieve** (:mod:`kip.core.retrieval.hybrid`) -- dense and keyword axes,
   fused. Recall-oriented: it is cheaper to over-fetch here than to miss the only
   passage that held the answer.
2. **Gate** (:func:`kip.core.rag.grounding.check_evidence`) -- if nothing similar
   enough came back, refuse *before* calling the model. No generation happens on
   an empty evidence base, which is the cheapest possible hallucination defence
   and the only one that is airtight.
3. **Hydrate** -- passage text is fetched by an injected callable. This package
   never imports a database; see the note on layering below.
4. **Rerank** (:mod:`kip.core.rerank`) -- precision-oriented reordering of the
   candidates that survived.
5. **Build context** (:mod:`kip.core.rag.context`) -- token-budgeted, numbered,
   capped per document. Whole documents never reach the model.
6. **Generate** (:mod:`kip.core.llm`) -- the only stage that may call out to a
   third party, and the only stage whose output cannot be trusted on its own.
7. **Verify** (:mod:`kip.core.rag.citations`, :mod:`kip.core.rag.grounding`) --
   markers resolved to real chunks, invented markers stripped and counted, every
   claim scored against the passage it cites.

**Layering.** Hydration and document titles arrive as callables rather than a
repository object, so ``kip.core`` stays free of any persistence import and the
whole pipeline is testable with a dictionary. It also means the evaluation harness
can run the identical pipeline over a fixture corpus with no database at all,
which is what makes its numbers comparable to the ones the running application
produces.

**Refusal is an outcome, not an exception.** Every path that cannot produce a
grounded answer returns an :class:`Answer` with ``refused=True`` and a machine-
readable ``refusal_reason``, so the interface can explain *why* and the evaluation
dashboard can count refusals by cause rather than lumping them together.

**What is measured is recorded.** Every stage's duration is on the answer. The
performance numbers in the README come from this field, on a stated machine, over
a stated corpus -- not from an estimate.

**Async hydration support.** The ``hydrate`` callable passed to :class:`RagPipeline`
may be either a regular function or an async function. If it returns a coroutine,
it will be awaited automatically. This allows the hydration step to perform async
I/O (e.g. database lookups) while keeping the pipeline itself synchronous for
the common case.

    ...     hydrate=lambda ids: {i: passages[i] for i in ids if i in passages},
    ...     titles=lambda ids: {"d1": "Mango Drying Study"},
    ... )

    A question the corpus answers produces a cited answer, and the citation
    resolves to the chunk the text actually came from:

    >>> answer = asyncio.run(pipeline.answer("At what temperature are mango slices dried?"))
    >>> answer.refused
    False
    >>> answer.text
    'Hot air drying of mango slices is carried out at 60 C for eight hours [1].'
    >>> [(c.marker, c.id, c.document_label) for c in answer.citations]
    [(1, 'd1:0', 'Mango Drying Study')]
    >>> answer.citations[0].text in passages.values()
    True
    >>> answer.groundedness, answer.citation_report.coverage
    (1.0, 1.0)

    A question the corpus does not answer is refused rather than answered from
    the nearest available passage:

    >>> miss = asyncio.run(pipeline.answer("What is the tensile strength of the conveyor belt?"))
    >>> miss.refused, miss.text
    (True, 'The available documents do not contain enough information to answer this question.')
    >>> miss.refusal_reason in {'weak_match', 'model_refused'}
    True

    Every stage is timed, and the refusal path stops early -- there is no generate
    stage when the evidence gate refuses:

    >>> [s.name for s in answer.stages]
    ['retrieve', 'gate', 'hydrate', 'rerank', 'context', 'generate', 'verify']
    >>> gate = asyncio.run(pipeline.answer("xylophone tessellation", min_score=0.99))
    >>> gate.refused, gate.refusal_reason, [s.name for s in gate.stages]
    (True, 'weak_match', ['retrieve', 'gate'])
    >>> gate.usage.prompt_tokens
    0

    Restricting to a document restricts the evidence base, and a question the
    selected document does not cover is refused rather than answered from a
    document the user excluded:

    >>> scoped = asyncio.run(pipeline.answer("retort sterilisation temperature",
    ...                          document_ids=["d2"]))
    >>> scoped.refused, scoped.context.document_ids
    (False, ('d2',))
    >>> scoped.text
    'Retort sterilisation of canned vegetables is performed at 121 C [1].'
    >>> asyncio.run(pipeline.answer("retort sterilisation temperature",
    ...                 document_ids=["d1"])).refusal_reason
    'weak_match'

    Selecting no documents retrieves nothing rather than silently searching
    everything:

    >>> asyncio.run(pipeline.answer("mango", document_ids=[])).refusal_reason
    'no_passages'

    The context holds every passage the model was shown; the citations hold only
    the ones it used. Both are reported, because conflating them would hide how
    much evidence was considered:

    >>> answer.context.document_ids, answer.document_ids
    (('d1', 'd2', 'd3'), ('d1',))

    An empty question refuses at the gate instead of prompting the model with
    nothing:

    >>> asyncio.run(pipeline.answer("   ")).refusal_reason
    'no_passages'

    A chunk that cannot be hydrated is dropped, and if that leaves nothing the
    refusal says so instead of citing a passage with no text:

    >>> blind = RagPipeline(
    ...     retriever=HybridRetriever(embedder, store, keyword),
    ...     llm=ExtractiveClient(), hydrate=lambda ids: {})
    >>> asyncio.run(blind.answer("dried mango")).refusal_reason
    'no_passage_text'
